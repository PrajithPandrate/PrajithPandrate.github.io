<p>Cybersecurity: The state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this.</p>
<hr/>
  <p>Cybersecurity or data innovation security is the assurance of PC frameworks from robbery or harm to their equipment, programming or electronic information, just as from disturbance or confusion of the administrations they give. This in simpler words is, that cybersecurity assures that your computer is free of harm and makes sure that your data can't be robbed.</p>
 <hr/>
 <p>Cyberterrorism is the disruptive use of information technology by terrorist groups to further their ideological or political agenda. This takes the form of attacks on networks, computer systems and telecommunication infrastructures.</p>
<p>Cyberwarfare involves nation-states using information technology to penetrate another nation’s networks to cause damage or disruption. In the U.S. and many other nations, cyberwarfare has been acknowledged as the fifth domain of warfare (following land, sea, air and space).</p> <p>Cyberwarfare attacks are primarily executed by hackers who are well-trained in exploiting the intricacies of computer networks, and operate under the auspices and support of nation-states. Rather than “shutting down” a target’s key networks, a cyberwarfare attack may intrude into networks to compromise valuable data, degrade communications, impair such infrastructural services as transportation and medical services, or interrupt commerce.</p>
<p>Cyberespionage is the practice of using information technology to obtain secret information without permission from its owners or holders. Cyberespionage is most often used to gain strategic, economic, political or military advantage, and is conducted using cracking techniques and malware.</p>
